Fiber Tract Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------
I start to do some fiber tract analysis work now. Programs need
to write to do analysis. I plan to put some useful programs here to
help myself write documentation.

### ReadFiberTract
We used Fibe-Tracking of DTI-Studio to track all fibers. Fibers 
saved in a specified format. Using this program to read out all 
all the points' 3D coordinate information of all tracts.
